# Silent-Speak-Sign-Language-Recognition with Python

SilentSpeak is a sign language recognition project using Python libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities by recognizing hand gestures representing signs and translating them into text.


### Requirements

* Python 3.7 or later **recommended: 3.10** - Download from `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
* OpenCV-Python `pip install opencv-python`
* MediaPipe `pip install mediapipe`
* Scikit-learn `pip install scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download it from the official Python website.
2. **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):** A virtual environment isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python installations. Use tools like `venv` or `conda` for creation.
3. **Install Required Libraries:** Activate the virtual environment (if created) and install the required libraries.
